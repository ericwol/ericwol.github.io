Academic profile
------
I obtained my PhD in Statistical Signal and Image Processing at the University of Nice (France) in 2006, working on theoretical aspects of robust estimation methods and their application to image processing. In 2007 I joined the Signal Processing Group at Technische Universität Darmstadt (Germany), where I worked on developing robust methods for tracking wireless terminals in realistic environments. 

I joined the diagnostic imaging group within the Statistics Department at UCC in 2008 as a postdoc. I am now a Statistics lecturer at the School of Mathematical Sciences, a funded investigator with the SFI Insight Centre for Data Analytics, and MSc Data Science & Analytics program joint director.
In both my research and teaching I specialise in the fields of spatial modelling, statistical and machine learning, risk characterisation, analysis of temporal data, and adaptive estimation, with applications to biomedical imaging, actuarial science and FinTech.

My most established research activity focuses on the development of spatial statistical methods for the analysis of radiological image data, for cancer patient risk characterisation. I consider in particular problems related to non-invasive assessment of prognosis, staging and chances of disease recurrence, mainly from PET imaging data but also from MRI and CT information. The scope of this work has evolved to integrate radiomics, a machine learning methodology for predictive modelling based on hundreds or thousands of radiological image features. 

My interest in machine learning has led me to experiment with other applications including non-life insurance premium pricing, and prediction from intermittent sales time series.
